**Problem Statement**

Many foundational number-theory functions—such as checking primality, computing divisor-based properties, or analyzing numeric patterns—are essential for understanding algorithms, cryptography, and mathematical computation. However, students often struggle to connect theory with implementation.
This project aims to develop a structured collection of Python functions that compute key number-theory operations efficiently and accurately. It helps learners understand mathematical logic, algorithmic design, and computational efficiency through hands-on coding.

**Scope of the Project**
The scope of this project includes:

- Implementing 40+ number-theory functions such as Euler’s Totient, Möbius Function, Digital Root, Prime Checking, CRT Solver, Modular Arithmetic, etc.
- Using Python to build practical, optimized, and easy-to-understand implementations.
- Covering mathematical concepts such as prime factorization, divisor functions, modular arithmetic, recursion, and algorithm optimization.
- Supporting students in understanding both mathematical principles and efficient programming methodologies.
- Generating outputs, verifying edge cases, and analyzing complexity for each function.
- Serving as a lab manual or reference guide for computational number theory and programming practice.

**Target Users**
This project is designed for:

- Students in computer science, mathematics, or engineering who are learning number theory and Python programming.
- Beginners who want hands-on experience writing logic-based mathematical algorithms.
- Educators who need structured examples for teaching algorithmic problem solving.
- Competitive programming learners looking to strengthen their number-theory fundamentals.
- Developers exploring cryptographic basics or mathematical computation.

**High-Level Features**
